## ✨ Project 1: Data Preprocessing

### 📝 Objective:

Prepare a raw dataset by cleaning, handling missing values, and normalizing it for downstream machine learning workflows.

### 🔧 What I Did:

* Loaded dataset via **Pandas**
* Identified and filled/removed missing values
* Applied **normalization** techniques
* Exported a clean version for further analysis

### 🛠️ Stack:

`Python` · `Pandas` · `Jupyter Notebook`

---

## ✨ Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 📝 Objective:

Discover trends, patterns, and correlations in the cleaned data through visual storytelling.

### 🔍 What I Did:

* Generated summary statistics
* Plotted histograms, heatmaps, boxplots using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
* Extracted actionable insights for the ML pipeline

### 📊 Tools Used:

`Python` · `Pandas` · `Matplotlib` · `Seaborn`

## ✨ Project 3: Linear Regression Model

### 📝 Objective:

Develop a predictive model using linear regression to forecast a continuous target variable.

### 📈 What I Did:

* Split the dataset into training/testing subsets
* Trained a **Linear Regression** model using **Scikit-learn**
* Evaluated performance using **R²**, **MAE**, and **MSE**
* Interpreted model coefficients to understand feature influence

### 🧰 Toolkit:

`Python` · `Scikit-learn` · `Jupyter Notebook`
